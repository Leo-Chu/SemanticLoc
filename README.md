Soure code for the paper, entitled "Exploiting Semantic Localization in Highly Dynamic Wireless Networks using Deep Homoscedastic Domain Adaptation" 


Due to a tight schedule, we provide an orignal version of the codes. you can directly run them to reproduce the results in the paper. 

We will sit down and provide a clean version soon.
